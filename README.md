### [Play it here!](https://sharemygame.com/@Quasar_/desire-to-scape)

There are only two - you and your rocket. You both are on the strange planet made entirely from cubes. Some of them might glow, some of them tends to move a lot. But you know that if your rocket touch one of them - it will immediately explode.  Your only wish is to escape from this strange and dangerous place. But can you?...

Control your rocket thrust with Space key and rotate with A and D. If you somehow got stuck - press R to restart the level. Don't forget to turn on the music and good luck!
